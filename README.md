### üîê Authentication & Role System

#### Roles:
- **Admin**: Can add/update/delete team, projects, assign members
- **Member**: Can only view assigned projects and update messages/status

Use **JWT-based Auth** for backend:
- `POST /auth/register` ‚Üí for admin
- `POST /auth/login` ‚Üí for both
- Middleware to verify role: `authMiddleware("admin")`
